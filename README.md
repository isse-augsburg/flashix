The work is part of the project [*Verifcation of Flash File Systems*](http://isse.de/flashix)
(orig.  Verifikation von Flash-Dateisystemen, RE828/13-1, DFG/German Research Council).

This repository contains the [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) code automatically
derived from the [KIV](http://isse.de/kiv) specifications.
It provides a fully working prototype and simulation of the file system that can
be mounted into the Linux directory tree via [FUSE](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/).
Storage is either a plain file or an [MTD](http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/)-device.

See the [technical documentation](https://swt.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/swt/projects/flash.html)
for an overview of the concepts realized and a list of [publications](http://isse.de/flashix/publications).
